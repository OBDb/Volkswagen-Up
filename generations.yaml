    description: "The Volkswagen Up (stylized as 'up!') is a city car introduced in 2011 to serve as Volkswagen's entry-level model. Built on the NSF (New Small Family) platform, it features a space-efficient design with a length of just 3.54 meters while maximizing interior space through a 2.42-meter wheelbase and wheels pushed to the corners. Initially available as a three-door, a five-door variant was added in 2012. The exterior design is characterized by clean, simple lines with a distinctive glass tailgate and minimalist detailing. Engine options have evolved over time but typically center around small, efficient petrol engines, primarily 1.0-liter three-cylinder units with power outputs ranging from 60 to 90 horsepower. A fully electric e-Up was introduced in 2013, offering zero-emission urban mobility. The interior features a surprisingly spacious cabin for its exterior dimensions, with a straightforward dashboard design, a detachable infotainment device (later updated to a more conventional touchscreen), and clever storage solutions. A significant facelift in 2016 updated the styling, technology, and powertrains, while a sportier Up GTI variant with 115 horsepower arrived in 2018. Throughout its life, the Up has maintained its position as an affordable, high-quality city car that brings Volkswagen's characteristic refinement to the A-segment, though it has been discontinued in some markets as urban mobility trends shift toward electrification."
